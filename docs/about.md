A Little About Me
I have had diabetes for over 56 years and have gathered information to help others manage it. By using exercise, CGMs, pumps, or Pods, and making better food choices, we can hopefully control our blood sugar levels more effectively.
Diabetes is challenging, especially when dealing with other life issues. For someone newly diagnosed, understanding it all quickly can be overwhelming. Finding the right information is crucial.
The internet provides a vast amount of information, which can sometimes be confusing due to rapid changes and the presence of incorrect or outdated content. It is essential for documents to be updated regularly so that individuals can access the latest information, particularly for those managing diabetes. The goal is to ensure that accurate and current information is available.
Having used computers since the ZX81, which featured a black and white screen with no sound in the 1970s, I have observed significant advancements. Today, in 2021, computers play a crucial role in helping Diabetics manage their condition more effectively. As technology continues to evolve, it is hoped that managing diabetes will become even easier, and efforts will be made to contribute to this progress.


For more information on diabetes, I recommend visiting <a href="https://www.diabetes.org.uk/" target="_blank">

The focus here will be on Type 1 Diabetes. Although many aspects may also apply to Type 2 Diabetes, my familiarity and experience are with Type 1 Diabetes.
I plan to add new foods and recipes to my website, which I started in January 2021. I hope other diabetes communities will adopt this approach too. Using MyFitnessPal for quick scans is a useful tool. I encourage more Type 1 diabetics to join our rides, and I will share the routes with you. Though I'm not a cycling leader, I ride to better manage my Diabetes.
I started this site to learn web development and now aim to share new information and programs related to diabetes management through technology. Enjoy the documents and cycling events, but importantly, get out on a bike to help manage your diabetes. Xdrip and Nightscout are challenging to set up initially, but they are valuable tools once operational. Xdrip, in particular, should be running smoothly after a 2-hour warm-up period as of this writing. I've managed to create websites despite my grammar issues, and I'm working on improving my English writing skills.
Technology has truly revolutionised how we manage diabetes, especially for those of us with Type 1. Devices like Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) and insulin pumps have paved the way for a more manageable and precise lifestyle. These advancements, paired with apps that sync effortlessly to provide real-time data, empower us to track our blood glucose levels with unparalleled accuracy. Itâ€™s remarkable how something that once seemed futuristic is now a reality, shaping how we take care of ourselves.
Beyond technology, the sense of community and shared knowledge among diabetics has become a cornerstone of support. Whether it's through online forums, local diabetes groups, or cycling events, connecting with others who share similar experiences can make a world of difference.
If you have spare time and enjoy designing and writing, please contact me. Your help would be greatly appreciated!
My focus is on the future of diabetes and guiding people through the world of CGM, pumps, and pods. This setup is complex, and I seek support to do it correctly.
Initially, I will post recipes and food guides. I hope you enjoy the site and return for updates, video tips, and articles. Best wishes for a happier T1 life!

It would be really good if xdrip, AAPS and Nightscout could make there own Pods to go with these software packages, and for us all not having to wait another 5 years to get things we need now.  And a way forward so they can be tested quicker, so we are not waiting like we are!
