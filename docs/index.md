A little About Me!
I do not Drink<br>
:beer:<br>
or Smoke :material-cigar-off: <br><br>
        I like to try to go out for a quite :material-bicycle: :man_biking_tone3: when the weather is good :material-weather-sunny:, and there is little wind to help on all of my Type 1 issues.<br>    
<br>
I have been living with type 1 diabetes for 54 years, starting with pork insulin known as Semilente. My mother had to care for me with the help of black and red lines, a challenging task. For over 16 years, my condition was poorly controlled as I relied on urine testing and later urine test strips before transitioning to blood glucose testers.<br>

I even used a device, a sort of "gun," to inject the blunt needles into me once a day. Through this repository and my video setups, I hope to continue contributing to improvements in our daily lives. <br>



With Nightscout, Xdrip+ and Android APS
