I do not Drink  or Smoke           I like to try to go out for a quite   when the weather is good , and there is little wind to help on all of my Type 1 issues.  I have been living with type 1 diabetes for 54 years, starting with pork insulin known as Semilente. My mother had to care for me with the help of black and red lines, a challenging task. For over 16 years, my condition was poorly controlled as I relied on urine testing and later urine test strips before transitioning to blood glucose testers.</p> <p>I even used a device, a sort of \"gun,\" to inject the blunt needles into me once a day. Through this repository and my video setups, I hope to continue contributing to improvements in our daily lives. </p> <p>With Nightscout, Xdrip+ and Android APS</p> <p></p> <p>And a Big thank you to Chris from \ud83e\ude78Blood \ud83d\udca6Sweat and \u2699Gears      </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"#disclaimer-and-informing","title":"Disclaimer And Informing","text":"<ol> <li> <p>All information, thought, and code described here are intended for informational and educational purposes only.

A Little About Me I have had diabetes for over 56 years and have gathered information to help others manage it. By using exercise, CGMs, pumps, or Pods, and making better food choices, we can hopefully control our blood sugar levels more effectively. Diabetes is challenging, especially when dealing with other life issues. For someone newly diagnosed, understanding it all quickly can be overwhelming. Finding the right information is crucial. The internet provides a vast amount of information, which can sometimes be confusing due to rapid changes and the presence of incorrect or outdated content. It is essential for documents to be updated regularly so that individuals can access the latest information, particularly for those managing diabetes. The goal is to ensure that accurate and current information is available. Having used computers since the ZX81, which featured a black and white screen with no sound in the 1970s, I have observed significant advancements. Today, in 2021, computers play a crucial role in helping Diabetics manage their condition more effectively. As technology continues to evolve, it is hoped that managing diabetes will become even easier, and efforts will be made to contribute to this progress.</p> <p>For more information on diabetes, I recommend visiting  , a reliable resource for comprehensive details about the condition.</p> <p>The focus here will be on Type 1 Diabetes. Although many aspects may also apply to Type 2 Diabetes, my familiarity and experience are with Type 1 Diabetes. I plan to add new foods and recipes to my website, which I started in January 2021. I hope other diabetes communities will adopt this approach too. Using MyFitnessPal for quick scans is a useful tool. I encourage more Type 1 diabetics to join our rides, and I will share the routes with you. Though I'm not a cycling leader, I ride to better manage my Diabetes. I started this site to learn web development and now aim to share new information and programs related to diabetes management through technology. Enjoy the documents and cycling events, but importantly, get out on a bike to help manage your diabetes. Xdrip and Nightscout are challenging to set up initially, but they are valuable tools once operational. Xdrip, in particular, should be running smoothly after a 2-hour warm-up period as of this writing. I've managed to create websites despite my grammar issues, and I'm working on improving my English writing skills. Technology has truly revolutionised how we manage diabetes, especially for those of us with Type 1. Devices like Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) and insulin pumps have paved the way for a more manageable and precise lifestyle. These advancements, paired with apps that sync effortlessly to provide real-time data, empower us to track our blood glucose levels with unparalleled accuracy. It\u2019s remarkable how something that once seemed futuristic is now a reality, shaping how we take care of ourselves. Beyond technology, the sense of community and shared knowledge among diabetics has become a cornerstone of support. Whether it's through online forums, local diabetes groups, or cycling events, connecting with others who share similar experiences can make a world of difference. If you have spare time and enjoy designing and writing, please contact me. Your help would be greatly appreciated! My focus is on the future of diabetes and guiding people through the world of CGM, pumps, and pods. This setup is complex, and I seek support to do it correctly. Initially, I will post recipes and food guides. I hope you enjoy the site and return for updates, video tips, and articles. Best wishes for a happier T1 life!</p> <p>It would be really good if xdrip, AAPS and Nightscout could make there own Pods to go with these software packages, and for us all not having to wait another 5 years to get things we need now.  And a way forward so they can be tested quicker, so we are not waiting like we are!</p>"},{"location":"index_bk/","title":"Index bk","text":""},{"location":"index_bk/#welcome-to-the-diabeticway","title":"Welcome to The Diabeticway","text":"<p>For full Web site content visit The Diabetic Way.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"index_bk/#documents-we-will-be-covering","title":"Documents: - we will be covering","text":""},{"location":"index_bk/#xdrip-android-aps-nightscout-readthetips","title":"Xdrip-Android-APS-Nightscout-readthetips","text":""},{"location":"index_bk/#1-dexcom-test","title":"1 - Dexcom test","text":"<p>Menu 1: Dexcom</p>"},{"location":"index_bk/#2-download-xdrip","title":"2 - Download xdrip","text":"<p>Menu 2: Download xdrip </p>"},{"location":"index_bk/#3-nightscout-setup","title":"3 - Nightscout Setup","text":"<p>Menu 3: Nightscout Setup </p>"},{"location":"index_bk/#4-cgm-watches-setups","title":"4 - CGM Watches Setups","text":"<p>Menu 4: CGM Watches Setups</p>"},{"location":"index_bk/#5-t1s-smart-home","title":"5 - T1's Smart Home","text":"<p>Menu 5: T1's Smart Home</p>"},{"location":"index_bk/#6-freestyle-libre","title":"6 - Freestyle Libre","text":"<p>Menu 6: Freestyle Libre</p>"},{"location":"index_bk/#7-androidaps","title":"7 - AndroidAPS","text":"<p>Menu 7: AndroidAPS</p>"},{"location":"index_bk/#8-medtronic","title":"8 - Medtronic","text":"<p>Menu 8: Medtronic</p>"},{"location":"index_bk/#9-diabetes-helpful-things","title":"9 - Diabetes Helpful Things","text":"<p>Menu 9: Diabetes Helpful Things </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"index_bk/#disclaimer-and-informing","title":"Disclaimer And Informing","text":"<ol> <li> <p>All information, thought, and code described here is intended for informational and educational purposes only.

Defaults that can be adjusted with extended setting</p> <p>DISPLAY (unsmoothed) - Allows the user to control which algorithm is used to calculate the displayed raw BG values using the most recent calibration record. unfiltered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's unfiltered value. filtered - Raw BG is calculated by applying the calibration to the glucose record's filtered value. The glucose record's filtered values are generally produced by the CGM by a running average of the unfiltered values to produce a smoothed value when the sensor noise is high. unsmoothed - Raw BG is calculated by first finding the ratio of the calculated filtered value (the same value calculated by the filtered setting) to the reported glucose value. The displayed raw BG value is calculated by dividing the calculated unfiltered value (the same value calculated by the unfiltered setting) by the ratio. The effect is to exagerate changes in trend direction so the trend changes are more noticeable to the user. This is the legacy raw BG calculation algorithm. iob (Insulin-on-Board) Adds the IOB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins. Uses treatments with insulin doses and the dia and sens fields from the treatment profile.</p> <p>cob (Carbs-on-Board) Adds the COB pill visualization in the client and calculates values that used by other plugins.

After some time, as volume of stored data grows, it may happen that this limit is reached and system is unable to store new data. This plugin provides pill that indicates size of Database and shows (when configured) alarms regarding reaching space limit.</p> <p>IMPORTANT: This plugin can only check how much space database already takes, but cannot infer max size available on server for it. To have correct alarms and realistic percentage, DBSIZE_MAX need to be properly set - according to your mongoDB hosting configuration.</p> <p>NOTE: This plugin rely on db.stats() for reporting logical size of database, which may be different than physical size of database on server. It may work for free tier of MongoDB on Atlas, since it calculate quota according to logical size too, but may fail for other hostings or self-hosted database with quota based on physical size.</p> <p>NOTE: MongoDB Atlas quota is for all databases in cluster, while each instance will get only size of its own database only. It is ok when you only have one database in cluster (most common scenario) but will not work for multiple parallel databases. In such case, spliting known quota equally beetween databases and setting DBSIZE_MAX to that fraction may help, but wont be precise.</p> <p>All sizes are expressed as integers, in Mebibytes 1 MiB == 1024 KiB == 1024*1024 B</p> <p>DBSIZE_MAX (496) - Maximal allowed size of database on your mongoDB server, in MiB. You need to adjust that value to match your database hosting limits - default value is for standard Heroku mongoDB free tier. DBSIZE_WARN_PERCENTAGE (60) - Threshold to show first warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size - pill will show size in yellow. DBSIZE_URGENT_PERCENTAGE (75) - Threshold to show urgent warning about database size. When database reach this percentage of DBSIZE_MAX size, it is urgent to do backup and clean up old data. At this percentage info pill turns red. DBSIZE_ENABLE_ALERTS (false) - Set to true to enable notifications about database size. DBSIZE_IN_MIB (false) - Set to true to display size of database in MiB-s instead of default percentage. This plugin should be enabled by default, if needed can be diasabled by adding dbsize to the list of disabled plugins, for example: DISABLE=\"dbsize\".</p> <p>Extended Settings Some plugins support additional configuration using extra environment variables. These are prefixed with the name of the plugin and a _. For example setting MYPLUGIN_EXAMPLE_VALUE=1234 would make extendedSettings.exampleValue available to the MYPLUGIN plugin.</p> <p>Plugins only have access to their own extended settings, all the extended settings of client plugins will be sent to the browser.</p> <p>DEVICESTATUS_ADVANCED (true) - Defaults to true. Users who only have a single device uploading data to Nightscout can set this to false to reduce the data use of the site. DEVICESTATUS_DAYS (1) - Defaults to 1, can optionally be set to 2. Users can use this to show 48 hours of device status data for in retro mode, rather than the default 24 hours. Setting this value to 2 will roughly double the bandwidth usage of nightscout, so users with a data cap may not want to update this setting. Pushover In addition to the normal web based alarms, there is also support for Pushover based alarms and notifications.</p> <p>To get started install the Pushover application on your iOS or Android device and create an account.</p> <p>Using that account login to Pushover, in the top left you\u2019ll see your User Key, you\u2019ll need this plus an application API Token/Key to complete this setup.</p> <p>You\u2019ll need to Create a Pushover Application. You only need to set the Application name, you can ignore all the other settings, but setting an Icon is a nice touch. Maybe you'd like to use this one?</p> <p>Pushover is configured using the following Environment Variables:</p> <ul> <li><code>ENABLE</code> - <code>pushover</code> should be added to the list of plugin, for example: <code>ENABLE=\"pushover\"</code>.</li> <li><code>PUSHOVER_API_TOKEN</code> - Used to enable pushover notifications, this token is specific to the application you create from in Pushover, additional pushover information below.</li> <li><code>PUSHOVER_USER_KEY</code> - Your Pushover user key, can be found in the top left of the Pushover site, this can also be a pushover delivery group key to send to a group rather than just a single user.  This also supports a space delimited list of keys.  To disable <code>INFO</code> level pushes set this to <code>off</code>.</li> <li><code>PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY</code> - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide alarms (level &gt; <code>WARN</code>).  If not defined this will fallback to <code>PUSHOVER_USER_KEY</code>.  A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to a CWD that you don't want to send all notification too.  This also support a space delimited list of keys.  To disable Alarm pushes set this to <code>off</code>.</li> <li><code>PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY</code> - An optional Pushover user/group key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements.  If not defined this will fallback to <code>PUSHOVER_USER_KEY</code> or <code>PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY</code>.  This also support a space delimited list of keys. To disable Announcement pushes set this to <code>off</code>.</li> <li><code>BASE_URL</code> - Used for pushover callbacks, usually the URL of your Nightscout site, use https when possible.</li> <li><code>API_SECRET</code> - Used for signing the pushover callback request for acknowledgments.</li> </ul> <p>If you never want to get info level notifications (treatments) use <code>PUSHOVER_USER_KEY=\"off\"</code> If you never want to get an alarm via pushover use <code>PUSHOVER_ALARM_KEY=\"off\"</code> If you never want to get an announcement via pushover use <code>PUSHOVER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY=\"off\"</code></p> <p>If only <code>PUSHOVER_USER_KEY</code> is set it will be used for all info notifications, alarms, and announcements</p> <p>For testing/development try localtunnel. IFTTT Maker In addition to the normal web based alarms, and pushover, there is also integration for IFTTT Webhooks.</p> <p>With Maker you are able to integrate with all the other IFTTT Services. For example you can send a tweet when there is an alarm, change the color of hue light, send an email, send and sms, and so much more.</p> <p>Setup IFTTT account: login or create an account Follow the Detailed IFTTT setup Instructions Configure Nightscout by setting these webpage environment variables: ENABLE - maker should be added to the list of plugins, for example: ENABLE=\"maker\". MAKER_KEY - Set this to your secret key (see [Detailed Instructions ) MAKER_KEY=\"abcMyExampleabc123defjt1DeNSiftttmak-XQb69p\" This also supports a space delimited list of keys. MAKER_ANNOUNCEMENT_KEY - An optional Maker key, will be used for system wide user generated announcements. If not defined this will fallback to MAKER_KEY. A possible use for this is sending important messages and alarms to another device that you don't want to send all notification too. This also support a space delimited list of keys. Plugins can create custom events, but all events sent to IFTTT webhooks will be prefixed with ns-. The core events are:</p> <p>ns-event - This event is sent to the maker service for all alarms and notifications. This is good catch all event for general logging. ns-allclear - This event is sent to the maker service when an alarm has been ack'd or when the server starts up without triggering any alarms. For example, you could use this event to turn a light to green. ns-info - Plugins that generate notifications at the info level will cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. ns-warning - Alarms at the warning level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. ns-urgent - Alarms at the urgent level with cause this event to also be triggered. It will be sent in addition to ns-event. see the full list of events Treatment Profile Some of the plugins make use of a treatment profile that can be edited using the Profile Editor, see the link in the Settings drawer on your site.</p> <p>Treatment Profile Fields:</p> <p>timezone (Time Zone) - time zone local to the patient. Should be set. units (Profile Units) - blood glucose units used in the profile, either \"mg/dl\" or \"mmol\" dia (Insulin duration) - value should be the duration of insulin action to use in calculating how much insulin is left active. Defaults to 3 hours. carbs_hr (Carbs per Hour) - The number of carbs that are processed per hour, for more information see #DIYPS. carbratio (Carb Ratio) - grams per unit of insulin. sens (Insulin sensitivity) How much one unit of insulin will normally lower blood glucose. basal The basal rate set on the pump. target_high - Upper target for correction boluses. target_low - Lower target for correction boluses. Some example profiles are here.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"user-guide/Specifications/","title":"Specifications","text":""},{"location":"user-guide/Specifications/#welcome-to-the-diabetic-way","title":"Welcome to The Diabetic way","text":"<p>For full Website content visit The Diabetic Way.</p> <p>Nightscout Foundation</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/Specifications/#specifications","title":"Specifications","text":"<p>The current version of Nightscout\u00a0will probably not run\u00a0on anything older than these versions/platforms</p> <ul> <li><code>Android 4</code> - Create a new project.</li> <li><code>Chrome 68</code> - Start the live-reloading docs server.</li> <li><code>Edge 17</code> - Build the documentation site.</li> <li><code>Firefox 61</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> <li><code>OS 11</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> <li><code>Safari 10</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> <li><code>Opera 54</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> <li><code>Internet Explorer: not supported</code> - Print help message and exit.</li> </ul> <p></p> Version of Nightscout Video <p></p> <p>If you want to run a Nightscout site on a device that doesn\u2019t meet these minimum requirements, follow these instructions to build the latest version first, and then see\u00a0Nightscout documentations do a Google search, if you are unable to find the information</p> <p>Then please email us at\u00a0support@thediabeticway.co.uk</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/Alexa/T1_Pro_Cube/Alexa%20Show%20Nightscout%20on%20Echo%20Show%2010%203rd%20Gen/","title":"Add Nightscout onto an Echo Show","text":"<p>You will have already have had to setup a Nightscout site before you can do this setup, see Nightscout Setup if you have not already set it up.</p> <p>The latest software releases from Amazon for the Alexa Show 10 allows you to view with Silk Browser only on its display.
