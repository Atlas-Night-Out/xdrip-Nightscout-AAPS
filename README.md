# Cyb Netics Docs

## Hoping to help resolve issues we face with different setups and devices for Diabetics and make life easier.
I will be concentrating on xdrip+, AAPS, Nightscout, Android Watches, DexcomG6, Omnipods, Dana RS Pump


I found when I joined xdrip a few years 2017  there were no documents at all for it or help files only little ones spread about all over the place so I started to try to do videos on GitHub where it had never been done before this was in 2018 and from there I have had to learn not only about my type 1 again and collapsing into very bad hypos. But also doing this project to help. I find it hard at times to understand things due to dyslexia too and my Grammar is terrible so please bear with me and please help me by letting me know or maybe changing it yourself.

I hope these documents are of some help, but they will be constantly changing due to things happening around me to correct their mistakes in charging for their services. I do this as a hobby and when I can do it. and if I do not have the time energy or patience it does not get done I hope you understand this.

Others have now started to do documents and have taken on my ideas on doing what takes a lot of time to do but glad things are moving on for a great bit of software, that all Diabetics should be using.

There is still a long way to go and still lots of things need changing or the bugs somehow resoled, and I hope I can help by trying to do my little to help back on technology that is beyond my scope to do.

Nightscout is forever changing and lots of different servers to run it now, so I will not be covering all of them that is too much for me to keep up, so I will just stick with Heroku one that I first started with and have no issues.

I need all the help and support from my follow-up Diabetes friends Developers and whoever wishes to help to do these setups or ideas. I too need to keep alive with type 1 so I understand how important it is to try to make it a little easier for us all. If you are stuck or need help ask in the groups, or maybe inbox me or email me, I will try my best to help if I can.

I hope with help from others I can help back further and thank you for your help and support!


When I joined xdrip in 2017, documentation was sparse. In 2018, I began creating video tutorials on GitHub. Throughout this project, I've had to relearn aspects of type 1 diabetes management while also managing my own health challenges. Due to dyslexia, I find it difficult to understand some concepts, and my grammar may need correction.
These documents are intended to be helpful but will change as corrections are made for service charges. This is a hobby project, and updates depend on available time and energy.
Others have since started documenting these processes, which is beneficial for the diabetic community. Despite progress, there are still many bugs and improvements needed, which I aim to assist with as much as possible.
Nightscout changes frequently, and numerous servers now run it. I will primarily cover the Heroku setup, which I am most familiar with and have found reliable.
Support from fellow diabetics, developers, and volunteers is essential. Maintaining good health with type 1 diabetes is crucial, and ease of use for these technologies is important. For assistance, please ask in relevant groups or contact me directly via inbox or email.
With collective support, I hope to contribute further and appreciate any assistance provided.



To further support this initiative, I believe collaboration and pooling of knowledge are the keys to unlocking even greater potential for diabetics worldwide. The community's feedback and shared experiences are invaluable in identifying challenges and refining solutions, be it through troubleshooting bugs or adapting technology to meet individual needs.
Technology evolves rapidly, and staying abreast of these changes demands collective effort. Together, we can chart new paths, exploring innovations in wearable devices, pump integrations, and data-sharing platforms to ensure accessibility and reliability for all. Thank you to everyone who contributes to this journeyâ€”your involvement makes all the difference.
