When I joined xDrip in 2017, documentation was limited. By 2018, I began creating GitHub video tutorials. This project required relearning type 1 diabetes management while dealing with my own health issues. Dyslexia makes understanding some concepts hard, and my grammar may need corrections. These documents aim to be helpful but will evolve over time.<br>

 It’s a hobby project, so updates depend on my available time and energy. Others documenting these processes benefit the diabetic community. Despite progress, many bugs and improvements remain, which I strive to address.<br>

Nightscout often changes, and several servers now run it. I'll focus on Heroku setup, which I know best. Support from diabetics, developers, and volunteers is crucial. Managing type 1 diabetes well is vital, and making technology user-friendly is important. For help, ask in relevant groups or contact me directly.<br>

Collaboration and knowledge-sharing can significantly advance support for diabetics globally. Community feedback helps identify challenges and refine solutions, whether troubleshooting bugs or customizing technology. Rapid changes in tech require collective effort. Together, we can explore innovations in wearables, pump integrations, and data-sharing platforms to ensure accessibility and reliability. Thank you to everyone who contributes—your involvement is invaluable.

I also try to support Diabetes.uk and hence why I have them at the bottom of my pages. I also try to support JDRF now Breakthrough T1D - JDRF - UK: JDRF - UK as well with Helpful Links Page.
Hope the site helpful and please join me, I won't bit! :smile_cat:

NHS need to stop mistreating Type 1 Diabetics!
